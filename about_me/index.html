        <h2>Emmanuel Ndem</h2>
        <p>My name is Emmanuel Asukwo Ndem, but
           I go by "metalpadawan" on Call of Duty. I live in Cross River State Nigeria, with my family of seven: two brothers, two sisters, and my parents with me being the last of the litter.</p>
        <p>I am currently pursuing a degree in web and software development with a dream of establishing my very own gaming company. 
                My interests hobbies include anime, gaming, and the realm of creativity, often finding joy in exploring various creative endeavors.
                Additionally, I am an avid reader of high fantasy books, which constantly ignites my imagination.</p>
        <p>While I am not married yet, I do have plans for the future.
            Currently, I hold a part-time job in photo editing for BruceWallace Studies. 
            One of the aspects I admire about BYU Pathway is the accessibility it offers for quality education anywhere in the world.
            I am excited about the prospect of networking through this program and generating revenue to support my future goals.</p> 
        <p>Furthermore, I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for four years, with September 8th marking the anniversary of my fourth year.
             As a returned missionary, my favorite scripture is 2 Nephi 25:26, a verse that continually reminds me of my divine purpose.</p>
        <p>I am thrilled to embark on this educational journey and look forward to the opportunities it will bring as I work towards achieving my dreams.</p>
